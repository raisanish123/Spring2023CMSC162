You can choose to work in a pair
Part 1:
//Write the function template myMin to compute minimum of two numbers
You can refer to the myMax function in main.cpp
//Also write a function testMin which tests the function template
//Then type the function in main.cpp and invoke the function testMin in int main function
//Note: Type, do not copy so that you practice it properly

Part 2:
In mypair.h write a template function getMin that returns the minimum of the two data types
Add some examples in testMypair function to test getMin
